# Youth Aflame Social Club

## A Social Club for the Youth in the Stolberg City and around

Youth Aflame Social club is an association established to bring together the Youth of Stolberg-Germany
for one common mission and goal. Youth Aflame Social Club was established in 2020 by the Youth Ministry
within the community. We target young people between the ages of 13-25 years. It is a very interactive
group that helps in the good upbringing of young people. This Website is set up to help advertise the 
group and allow people to get information and sign up for the group.
